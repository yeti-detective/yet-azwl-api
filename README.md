# yet-azwl-api

Someone (*it was user [doitlikejustin](https://github.com/doitlikejustin)*) on here (github) had an Amazon Wishlist api that used webscrapping, but it stopped working.
I don't know what technology they used to build theirs, but I'm going to try to recreate a similar api using Node Osmosis

Love you, boo.
